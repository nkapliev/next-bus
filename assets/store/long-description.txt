Imagine your office.
Evening.
You are thinking about going home.
But waiting for a bus at a bus stop is so annoying/chilly/wetly.
Reading your favourite blog in cosy chair at warm office for another 7-10 minutes is a much better idea, isn't it?

Now you can arrive at the bus stop just in time to catch the next bus.
